### Correlation Matrix
A correlation matrix was computed for numeric variables. Higher absolute values indicate stronger relationships.

*(Due to fallback mode, detailed correlation insights are not provided. Consider reviewing the correlation_heatmap.png chart.)*

### Clustering
KMeans clustering suggested 3 clusters. Cluster counts:
- Cluster 0: 982 samples
- Cluster 1: 326 samples
- Cluster 2: 789 samples

            
## Observations and Recommendations
- Without LLM-driven insights, this fallback narrative focuses on basic metrics and structural aspects of the dataset.
- The presence (or absence) of missing values suggests potential data cleaning steps before any modeling or in-depth analysis.
- Outliers may indicate exceptional cases, errors, or unique opportunities that warrant further investigation.
- Correlation analysis can guide which variables relate strongly to each other, supporting feature selection or identifying potential explanatory variables.
- If clustering results are available, they may highlight natural groupings or segments within the data, which could be useful for targeted strategies or personalized approaches.

## Next Steps
- **Data Quality Improvements**: Consider imputing or removing missing values to ensure cleaner input for models.
- **Further Statistical Analysis**: Explore relationships between variables more thoroughly, potentially using statistical tests or more advanced modeling.
- **Domain-Specific Interpretation**: Integrate domain knowledge to better understand what certain outliers, correlations, or clusters might signify.
- **Additional Modeling**: Consider regression, classification, or forecasting methods (if applicable) to leverage the dataset for predictive insights.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Re-run analyses after data cleaning, feature engineering, or dimensionality reduction to improve the reliability of insights.
